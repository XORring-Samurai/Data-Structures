	// Place your snippets for cpp here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Print to console": {
		"prefix": "ModExp",
		"body": [
			"int Binexp (int a, int b, int m){",
			"        assert(b >= 0);",
			"        int res = 1;",
			"        while(b){",
			"                if(b & 1) res = (res * a) % m;",
			"                a = (a * a) % m;",
			"                b >>= 1;",
			"        }",
			"        return res;",
			"}"
		],
		"description": "Log output to console"
